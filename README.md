Flight Delay Prediction by building a machine learning model with Scikit-Learn and using Matplotlib to visualize output.

Through this project-

1. Create an Azure Notebook and import flight data
2. Use Pandas to clean and prepare data
3. Use Scikit-learn to build a machine-learning model
4. Use Matplotlib to visualize the output
